6 Companies 30 Days Challenge
This repository contains my solutions for the 6 Companies 30 Days Challenge conducted by Arsh Goyal in January 2025.

About the Challenge
The challenge was organized to help students and professionals prepare for coding interviews by solving top questions from companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.

The goal was to solve 1-2 questions daily for 30 days.

My Journey
I participated in the January 2025 edition.

I couldn't complete the full 30 days, but learned a lot during the process.

Shared whatever I was able to solve during the challenge.

Structure
Day 1: Questions + Solutions

Day 4: Questions + Solutions
(more folders would have been added if fully completed)

Credits
Thanks to Arsh Goyal for organizing this amazing initiative and providing guidance! üôè

Note
Even though I couldn't finish the challenge in 30 days, the effort helped improve my DSA skills and taught me consistency.
More to come! üöÄ
